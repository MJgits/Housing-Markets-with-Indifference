## Usage
Run the main file to execute the algorithm with some examples. Preferences have to be complete and inputted as per the examples.

This algorithm facilitates exchange of indivisible items among agents where each agent is endowed with one object and expresses weak preferences across all objects. Agents and objects should be inputted as integer values. E.g. for a three agent market, agents are represented by 0,1,2 with endowments 0,1,2. Weak preferences allow agents to be indifferent between subsets of objects in the market. E.g. If Agent 0 prefers either of object 0 or object 1 to its own object (object 2), we represent Agent 0's preferences = [{1,2},{0}].
